## 🚀 Key Features

### 🏢 Employer Hub & Premium Post Job Flow
*   **Unified Post Job Entry**: Seamless modal-to-wizard transition. Clicking "Post a job" triggers a selection modal (`PostJobModal`) allowing employers to choose hiring modes and upload job descriptions before entering the full-screen flow.
*   **Premium Post Job Wizard (`PostJobWizard`)**: A state-of-the-art multi-step form built with a highly responsive sidebar navigation, regional timezone shortcuts, and geopolitical policy configurations.
*   **Escrow & Vault Integration (Scheduled Hiring)**: Custom-designed Vault lifecycle panel that expands dynamically, featuring:
    *   Dynamic **Role specification version allowance meter** that tracks remaining allowed edits.
    *   Escrow lock fee warnings.
    *   Start/end date schedulers.
    *   Beautiful visual stepper of the Vault lifecycle.

### 👤 Talent Hub & Modernized Onboarding
*   **Robust Multi-Step Onboarding**: Smoothly guides professionals through identity verification, interest mapping, and professional backgrounds.
*   **Bidirectional ISO-2 Translation**: Seamlessly translates user-friendly dropdown options (like `Nigeria`, `United Kingdom`) into standard 2-letter ISO codes (`NG`, `GB`) to conform with strict backend API schemas, while performing reverse-mapping to keep components fully populated and reactive upon page reloads.

### 🔒 Core Services & Security
*   **VORA Query Client**: Unified query services structured in `@tanstack/react-query` under `src/services/queries/`.
*   **Secure Authentication Flow**: Integrated OTP verification and OAuth authentication.
*   **Resend Verification Code**: Updated standard registration flows to point to the correct backend `/api/v1/auth/resend-verification` endpoint.
