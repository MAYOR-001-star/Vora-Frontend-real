      <div className="text-[13.5px] text-[#1A1A1A] leading-[1.65]">
        Antenatal care (ANC) coverage in peri-urban communities of Lagos remains below national targets. This study evaluated the effect of a six-week community-based health education programme on ANC attendance rates among pregnant women.

      <div className="text-[13.5px] text-[#1A1A1A] leading-[1.65]">
        A cluster-randomised trial was conducted across 14 wards (7 intervention, 7 control) between May 2023 and February 2024. The intervention consisted of weekly group sessions facilitated by community health workers. The primary outcome was self-reported attendance of four or more ANC visits. Analyses used an intention-to-treat approach with mixed-effects logistic regression.

      <div className="text-[13.5px] text-[#1A1A1A] leading-[1.65]">
        A total of 612 women were enrolled (intervention n=304, control n=308). At 9 months, 71% in the intervention arm reported four or more ANC visits compared with 58% in the control arm (adjusted OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.62, p=0.003). Attrition was 14% overall; 11% in the intervention arm versus 17% in the control arm.

      <div className="text-[13.5px] text-[#1A1A1A] leading-[1.65]">
        Community-based health education significantly increased ANC attendance. Findings support wider implementation in similar peri-urban settings across Nigeria.
