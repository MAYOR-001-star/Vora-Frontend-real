They simply exist in a pre-qualified list that activates the moment your role goes live. Your Vault dashboard shows a live count of how many VORA candidates currently pre-qualify. That number updates in real time as new talent joins. If the number is zero today, it is honest. The value of scheduling further out is that it gives the pool more time to grow.',
